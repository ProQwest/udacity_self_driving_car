This repository contains all the projects I have completed for the [Self Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). There are over 11,000 people applied for this Nanodegree progam and I was selected as one of the 500 students for the very first cohort started in October 2016. The [curriculum](https://medium.com/self-driving-cars/term-1-in-depth-on-udacitys-self-driving-car-curriculum-ffcf46af0c08#.nglkprlow) of this program consists of three terms over nine months. This repository will be updated with my progress accordingly. 

## Term 1:  Computer Vision and Deep Learning
